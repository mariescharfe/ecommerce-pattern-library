Each button has its own purpose and is used with the primary branding colors to draw attention:

- The regular buttons are for light backgrounds.
- The light buttons are for dark backgrounds.
- The ghost buttons are for banners or buttons over images.

These can be mixed with the 'font-sizes' to make different sizes of buttons if they need to stand out more.
